# sortingAlgoriths

Insertion sort
  Time complexity:
                  Best case : o(n), when array is already sorted.  e.g [8,9,10,11]
                  worst case :o(n^2), when array is in decending order  .e.g [11,10,9,8]
  space complexity :
                    o(1), in place sorting algorithm 
        
  stablity :
               Depends on implementaion ,here in code it is stable,but if we keep (arr[j]>=key) it will not be stable.
